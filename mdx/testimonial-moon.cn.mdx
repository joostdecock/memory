I've had many different opportunities to learn Mandarin before (private
tutoring + group classes), but Jing is truly the best Mandarin teacher I've
ever had! Her teaching curriculum is delightful and practical, not the sort of
irrelevant textbook material you often come across. Jing is a gifted and
passionate teacher, and I count myself quite lucky to be her student.
