Jing is my favorite Chinese teacher! She is very easy to talk to, fun, helpful
and motivating. I don't have much confidence speaking Chinese yet but she
amazingly understands me more than I expect and always motivates me that I'm
doing okay. I feel so comfortable talking with her like I'm talking to my
friend so one hour passes really quickly! I hope to continue learning Chinese
with her whenever I can and get better at it so that I can talk about things I
want more freely.
