My family just moved to Taiwan. My son can speak some Mandarin but he was too
shy to have a conversation. Fortunately, I found Jing on the Internet. She is
very patient and relaxed, and my son has gone from only saying one or two words
at a time to telling Jing what he did this week whenever he sees Jing. Jing is
more like a friend to him. I was very happy to find such a tutor for my son.
